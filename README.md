1. In this iteration we completed the user stories for a teacher being able to add assignments/tasks for all students in their class and the story for a student being able to view their tasks. 
2. For our next iteration we will complete the user stories for teachers being able to set the student view to different categories and for students to be able to assign categories to their tasks.  
3. Right now, the functionality for adding students in the teacher view is not properly set up and we do not have our task categories fully working (there is no user option to set this currently so it shouldn't be noticable when running the program)
4. To run this program, "./run.sh" will run the script provided in the taskmanager folder.  The script will prompt to ask if you are a teacher or student.  In the teacher view you will be able to log in (existing log ins to use are: Ron Cytron or Doug Shook) and then you should be able to add tasks for the existing students (Emily, Jess, Sarah, Claire).  Once you have added a task (or multiple) for students in the teacher view you can then restart the program as the student and view the tasks assigned to that individual.
